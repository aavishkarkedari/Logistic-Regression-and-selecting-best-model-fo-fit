## Dataset Overview

The Pima Indians Diabetes Database contains various medical features and information about patients, with the goal of classifying patients as either diabetic or non-diabetic. The dataset is often used for binary classification tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.7+ recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/decision-tree-diabetes.git


Usage
Exploratory Data Analysis
Explore the dataset by running Diabetes_EDA.ipynb. This Jupyter Notebook provides insights into the dataset's structure, distributions, and relationships between features.
Decision Tree Model
Train and evaluate a Decision Tree classifier on the dataset by running Diabetes_DecisionTree.ipynb. This notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Model Evaluation
Examine the model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.
Visualize the results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Plot a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to assess the model's performance.
